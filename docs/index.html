            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate from the University of Houston Clear Lake. I got my BS in Computer Information Systems, Summa Cum Laude.
              I've always had a curiosity for technology, and I love to tinker and try new things with tech. I'm also a big fan of video games,
              such as Super Smash Bros, League of Legends, Counter Strike, etc. I was actually a part of the Smash Bros Team for the UHCL 
              gaming club during my last year at the school.

                    <h3>Emerging IT Recommendation Report Group Work</h3>
                    <p>In this project, my group and I wrote 2 different recommendation reports for a company 
                      in need of a Content Management System, and another company in need of a Motion Capture Systems.
                      Each recommendation report reviewed 3-4 different viable providers, and scored them based on many
                      different requirements in accordance with the IEEE Standards for IT Adoption.

                    <h3>Software Engineering Web Application: Medical Record System</h3>
                    <p>This was my first big solo project at UHCL. I created a Medical Record System using ASP.NET and a MySQL database.
                       Deliverables included a scope and task list, requirements, architecture, design, and pseudo code documents.

                    <h3>CIS Senior Project: Django Inventory Management System</h3>
                    <p>This was my senior project, in which 5 of my peers and I worked together to create an Inventory Management System
                      for food pantries. I learned how to create the frontend and backend of the Django web application on my own.
                      I also coordinated with both the database team and the report generator team in order to ensure connectivity to the web app.
                      The project was a success, and I got a lot of experience working with other people and handling conflicts.
